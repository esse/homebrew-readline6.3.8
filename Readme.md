How do I install these formulae?

Just brew tap esse/readline6.3.8 and then brew install readline.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can brew install esse/readline6.3.8.

You can also install via URL:

brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esse/homebrew-readline6.3.8/master/Formula/readline.rb (recommended)
